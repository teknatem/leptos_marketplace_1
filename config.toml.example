[database]
# Database file path
# 
# WINDOWS USERS: Use forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\)
# Windows accepts both types of slashes, but TOML requires special
# handling for backslashes in double-quoted strings.
#
# ✓ CORRECT (forward slashes):
# path = "C:/Users/username/Desktop/MPI/data/app.db"
#
# ✓ ALSO CORRECT (relative path):
# path = "data/app.db"
#
# ✓ ALSO CORRECT (double backslashes):
# path = "C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\MPI\\data\\app.db"
#
# ✓ ALSO CORRECT (single quotes for literal string):
# path = 'C:\Users\username\Desktop\MPI\data\app.db'
#
# ❌ WRONG (will cause parse error):
# path = "C:\Users\username\Desktop\MPI\data\app.db"

# Example 1: Relative path (database next to exe)
path = "data/app.db"

# Example 2: Absolute path on Windows
# path = "C:/Users/udv/Desktop/MPI/data/app.db"

# Example 3: Absolute path on Linux/Mac
# path = "/var/lib/marketplace/app.db"

# The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
